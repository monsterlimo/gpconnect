summary: "Getting involved with GP Connect"
---

We are supporting partnerships of health and care organisations and software suppliers to develop products that can use the data made available by the GP Connect APIs.

GP Connect is for direct patient care
Products can only help people share, view or act on information that they are already legally entitled to access but, can’t access easily because they are using different IT systems or set-ups. GP Connect APIs can only be used legally for direct patient care.
Partnerships

Partnerships must involve both:
•	an NHS commissioning or end user organisation
•	a software supplier who can work with this organisation to develop a product
End user organisations could be:
•	Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs)
•	GP practices working in a federation or hub
•	hospital trusts
•	111 or emergency care providers
•	organisations using Local Health Care Records
•	social care organisations
•	pharmacies

Your pilot product

Partnerships should work together to propose a product for development.  Any health and social care setting that has a clear need to access patient data across different systems could benefit from developing a product that uses GP Connect APIs.

For your proposal, you need to have a clear idea of:
•	the problem you are intending to build a solution for
•	how this solution will be used in practice to benefit patients and staff
•	which of the APIs you will use to do this (see Information for software suppliers)
If your proposal is accepted, we will support you through our ‘First of Type’ process, to develop and assure a product and get it working in your health and care setting.
Information for commissioning or end user organisations
Taking part in the GP Connect pilot will need active engagement. You will need:
•	time – to work with your partner to put the solution into practice
•	the ability to make changes to working practices – to implement the solution in health and care settings
•	legal data sharing agreements in place between every organisation that will use the product
You may also need funding if you are commissioning a completely new product. 
Benefits for commissioning or end user organisations
By the end of the pilot you will have a working, fully assured product for use in your chosen settings.
Information for software suppliers
You need to decide which GP Connect API you will use to develop your product. 
The APIs currently available are:
•	Access Record: HTML view – enables clinicians to view a patient’s medical record
•	Appointments Management – enables clinical staff to book, amend or cancel an appointment for a patient
•	Access Record: Structured data – enables an export of a patient’s medications and allergies 
Find out more about the APIs on the GP Connect GitHub site.
Funding arrangements should be agreed with the health and care organisation you’re working with.
Benefits for software suppliers
At the end of the pilot process, there will be a working product in use by the end user organisation. You will then be able to market this assured product to other areas and settings, using our procurement register of approved suppliers.
The First of Type process
We have developed the First of Type process to take partnerships through the pilot phase, to develop and test an assured product that works in the setting it was designed for. Real users will test the product and feed back on its strengths and any opportunities to improve it.
The end product will go through an assurance process to make sure it’s fit for purpose.
It will be assessed on:
•	clinical safety – checking there’s no risk in using this product in a clinical setting
•	information governance – protecting patient data to agreed high standards
•	technical conformance – how well it works with other systems
•	whether it does what it was designed to do
