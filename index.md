GP Connect is a national interoperability programme that's opening up information and data held within the different GP clinical systems for use across the whole of health and social care - ensuring patient medical information is available to the right clinician, at the right time, wherever they are. 

We're developing a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that will seamlessly connect the four main provider systems (EMIS Web, Vision, Microtest Open Evolution and TPP SystmOne) and allow them to exchange data with ease.

The development of applications that consume the data (allowing people to use or view information) will be the responsibility of local NHS organisations, which means they choose the system that best meets their needs and those of their patients (while, of course, ensuring that appropriate safety and governance measures are in place).
